        <h3 style="font-size:30px;">College Corinthians</h3>
        <ul>
  <li>My favourite sport is soccer. I play soccer with my local club College Corinthians.</li>
  <li>I play in the Munster Senior League. I normally play in midfield or at right back. We train two or three times a week. Usually our games are on during the weekend. </li>
  <li>I have been playing with Corinthians since I was ten so it is a club that I really care about.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Liverpool are the soccer team that I support. I began following them when I first got interested in soccer.</li>
            <li>Last Winter, I went to London to see Liverpool vs Arsenal at the Emirates stadium with my friends. It was a fantastic experience and I really enjoyed seeing the players up close.</li>

        <h3 style="font-size:30px;">Running</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I run with the UCC athletics team. I recently joined the club after starting college in UCC.</li>
            <li>I love running as it gives me a break from the mundane routine of college and work. I run on average two times a week.</li>
