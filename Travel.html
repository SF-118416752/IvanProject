        <li>I went to Paris on a school tour in 2016 for 3 days. It was my first time going to France and it was a great trip with my school friends.</li>
        <li>We saw various tourist attractions like the Eiffel tower and Arc de Triomphe.</li>
        <li>The highlight of the trip was most definitely watching PSG playing AS Monaco in a Ligue 1 game in the Le Parc des Princes.</li>
        <li>The game ended 2-0 to Monaco, Kylian Mbappe played the majority of the game and was outstanding.</li>
