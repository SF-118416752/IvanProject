        <h4>My interest in Consulting Services</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Consulting Services are a fantastic way for small businesses to remain competitive, small businesses must maximise current technologies. They must do this cost effectively and with little direct Information Technology (IT) experience. Maintaining a dedicated, full-time IT department, as do their larger counterparts, is simply too expensive, time consuming and inefficient for small businesses.</li>
            <li>As a company we offer customers the easy route where they can invest their time into their business or role and not be left distracted due to our services.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <ul>
            <li>People are generally happiest doing what they do best. And they get frustrated by distracting tasks that have nothing to do with their essential job functions. Doctors, Lawyers, Accountants, Architects, Engineers, Executives, Office Managers and most everyone else are at their best when they focus on their core competencies. The time and effort spent on figuring out Information Technology has a very real opportunity cost. Researching solutions, implementing new technology and fixing IT-related problems are extremely inefficient for non IT professionals. By using a professional technology services provider, internal staff are free to spend time focusing on revenue generating opportunities and the business of the business</li>
            <li>My consulting service ensure constant uptime as we know it is crucial for a business to be online and connected.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <ul>
            <li>Even a few minutes of systems downtime carry enormous business costs. Maximising uptime must be a high priority. Small businesses can longer afford issues with internet connectivity, email communications, corrupt data or systems failure â€“ the cost of reacting to these events is just too high.</li>
            <li>We take advantage of new technologies that will help your business recognise competitive advantage versus just levelling the playing field. Technology services providers keep up with the latest information technologies through ongoing training and real world experience. Our service knows how to implement the latest hardware, software, and network applications available. Most importantly we know which technologies are not worth the investment. The capability of these providers to make rapid moves, helps small businesses speed time to market. This offers a competitive advantage to our customers and also increases the ability for them to react to competitive threats. </li>
